# Inkwash Server

Personal-scale cloud backend for the **Zectrix Note 4** e-ink device —
stores alarms and todos per device and serves them over the sync contract.
Part of the [**Inkwash**](https://github.com/counhopig/inkwash-firmware)
ecosystem, alongside the device firmware, a PC tool and an MCP server for
agents.

## What it is

A small, **personal** cloud server for a handful of devices. The owner
signs in with a single `ADMIN_TOKEN` (full access to every device and
every account); other people can register console **accounts** and manage
**their own** devices. Each registered device gets its own bearer token
for the sync endpoint. The admin console (a Vue 3 app) is compiled into
the binary, so the server is a single deployable artifact.

## Run

Easiest path — [`scripts/start.sh`](scripts/start.sh) generates a `.env`
with a random `ADMIN_TOKEN`, runs `npm install` in `admin-ui/`, then
launches:

```bash
./scripts/start.sh
```

Manual setup:

```bash
printf 'ADMIN_TOKEN=%s\n' "$(openssl rand -hex 32)" > .env
npm install --prefix admin-ui
cargo run --release
```

Env vars:

| Var            | Default               | Purpose                                   |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `ADMIN_TOKEN`  | _(required)_          | Owner bearer token: full access to all devices & accounts |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite://inkwash.sqlite3` | Backend selector: `sqlite://…` or `postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db` |
| `BIND_ADDR`    | `0.0.0.0:8080`        | Listen address                            |

`.env` is loaded from the working directory; existing process
environment takes precedence. Set `DATABASE_URL` to a `postgres://` URL
to use PostgreSQL instead of the default SQLite file (the schema is
created automatically on first start).

On first load the console offers **Create account**; open it in a browser
at `http://<server>:8080/`, sign in with an account (or the `ADMIN_TOKEN`
via the "server owner" link) and register devices.

## API

- `GET /health` — unauthenticated liveness check.
- `GET /api/sync` — device-facing (`Bearer <device_token>`), ETag/304
  conditional pull (legacy; kept for older firmware).
- `POST /api/sync` — device-facing (`Bearer <device_token>`): uploads
  locally-changed `enabled`/`done`/importance flags and `inbox_read` seqs,
  merges them (unknown IDs ignored), returns the authoritative
  `{alarms, todos, inbox}` list plus an `inbox_read_acked` echo and an
  `inbox_truncated` flag. A request with `X-Inkwash-Poll: 1` is a
  **lightweight urgent poll**: the server answers immediately with
  `{"urgent": true|false}` — no merge, no full payload — so the firmware
  can check for high-priority messages on a short cron cadence without
  pulling everything. This is what current firmware calls — contract in
  the firmware repo's
  [`docs/sync-api.md`](https://github.com/counhopig/inkwash-firmware/blob/main/docs/sync-api.md).
- `POST/GET/DELETE /api/devices[/:id]` — admin. `Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>` sees
  every device; a console-account session sees only its own devices.
  Registration returns the device token exactly once.
- `/api/devices/:id/alarms` and `/todos` (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE, plus a
  DELETE-to-clear on each collection) — same auth rules as devices.
- `/api/devices/:id/channels` and `/channels/:channel_id` — manage external
  channels (webhook) for a device: create (returns the one-time token),
  list, update, delete, `POST .../rotate-token`.
- `POST /api/channels/:channel_id/messages` — **webhook delivery**:
  `Bearer <channel_token>` (a per-channel token, distinct from admin/device
  tokens), payload `{kind, title, body, priority?, when?}` with size
  limits, an optional `Idempotency-Key` header for dedup. `priority:
  "high"` marks the message urgent — the device shows a full-screen
  reminder and rings immediately. Inserts an inbox item and bumps the
  device's sync version.
- `/api/devices/:id/inbox` — admin debug view: `GET` (paged), `DELETE :seq`
  (single), `DELETE` (clear read messages).
- `/api/auth/register|login|logout` — console accounts. Register/login
  return a session bearer token (stored client-side); logout revokes it.
- `GET /api/auth/me` — validates a stored session token (or the admin
  token) on console load.
- `POST /api/auth/password` — change your account password (session auth).
- `GET /api/admin/accounts` — owner only (`ADMIN_TOKEN`): list every
  account with its device/session counts.
- `DELETE /api/admin/accounts/:id` — owner only: delete an account (its
  devices and sessions cascade).
- `POST /api/admin/accounts/:id/password` — owner only: reset an account's
  password.

Invalid times, dates, empty names/todos, overlong text and malformed
account credentials are rejected with HTTP 400 before reaching SQLite.

## Console

The embedded UI is a small Vue 3 app split into layered views (no router):

- **Dashboard** — stat strip (devices/alarms/todos/done), device cards,
  register-device.
- **Device** — alarms/todos editor for one device (add, toggle enabled /
  done, priority, delete, clear), plus **channels** (create/rotate webhook
  tokens) and the device **inbox** (view/delete messages).
- **Account** — session info, change password; when signed in with the
  `ADMIN_TOKEN`, an admin **Users** panel to list / delete accounts and
  reset their passwords.

## Tests

```bash
cargo test          # 19 tests: db CRUD/transactions, auth dispatch, sync
                    # merge, and the sync wire-contract fixtures
cd admin-ui && npm run build   # vue-tsc type check + vite build
```

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `cargo test` (plus the embedded admin-ui
build) on every push/PR. `scripts/check-logic-pin.sh` reports when the
pinned `inkwash-logic` revision (Cargo.toml) falls behind the firmware
repo's `logic/` HEAD; the wire-contract tests in `src/models.rs` fail if
the pinned shapes drift from `docs/sync-api.md`.

Exercised end-to-end against the physical device via `inkwash-desktop`.
